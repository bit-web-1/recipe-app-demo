<h2>About this site</h2>
<p>This is a demonstration of making a <a href="/recipes">responsive table design</a> in SvelteKit.</p>
<p>We are fetching a list of recipes from <a href="https://dummyjson.com/docs/recipes">dummyjson.com</a> and displaying them in a table view with plenty of columns showing on a large screen. Then as the screen size gets smaller, we are removing the least-needed columns to fix the layout.</p>
